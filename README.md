Quiz Game 

In this part, I will include one or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. I build a quiz game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is a functional game about general knowledge with a total of 5 questions. The presentations is minimalistic with warm colours which is the my prefer choice dsing. 

I consider my quiz game entretaining and great if you wish to test your general knowledge. The game is designed to be intuitive, so the user can focus on the game and not so much on how to go around the application. 

Features:

This game is based in three model pages, the landing page, where you can see the total number of questions and a functional button which takes you to the actual game. 

The next page model is the quiz game. It includes the number of questions as a header, the question itself, and the 4 possible answers. Using JavaScript I could implement the following features. When an answer is marked correctly the answer turn green. The same for the incorrect answers, when you sleect an answer which is wrong, the answer section turn red. Also has the feature to restrict the user from selecting another answer once he has selected one response. 

The final page model is a summary of your game. You will be able to see your stadictis in a simple and comprehensive table, with data such as, how many questions answered. How many questions have you answered corrected, the precentatge of correct answers questions and your final total score. 

Testing:

The site has been tested using the validator testing sites for all the used languages. 

HTML: No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.
CSS: No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.
JavaScript: JavaScript code passes through a linter (e.g. jshint.com) with no significant issues.

Deployment

The depaloyment process was made using GitHub and the steps were as follow:

-In the GitHub repository, I went to the Setting tab
-From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
